# Planning 1

**Sprint 1 Basic RTS Game**

\* This will be something like a simple tower defence game

**1. Game Concept and Design**

* Define the core gameplay mechanics (e.g., resource gathering, unit control, combat).
* Create a basic storyboard or concept art.

2\. **Programs**

* Unity
* Recommend Visual studio 2022

Visual studio 2022 installer has an option to install the needed packages for unity game development(They might already have that since they have done a game project already)

3\. **Development Steps**

* Set up the project in Unity.
* Implement basic player controls and camera movement.
* Develop resource management and unit spawning systems.
* Integrate basic AI for enemy units.
* Implement basic UI elements (e.g., HUD, menus).

4\. **How-to Guide**

\* I’ll update this section later

5\. **Workshop**

* Lucas or/and me to prepare a workshop on Unity basics relevant to RTS development.

**Sprint 2 Basic 3D Game Development**

1\. **Game Concept and Design**

* Define the game genre and setting (e.g., adventure, platformer).
* Outline core mechanics (e.g., movement, interaction).

2\. **Programs**

* Unity
* Recommend Visual studio 2022

Visual studio 2022 installer has an option to install the needed packages for unity game development(They might already have that since they have done a game project already)

3\. **Development Steps**

* Implement player character movement and interaction.
* Design and integrate basic 3D assets (e.g., environment, characters).
* Add game logic (e.g., scoring, level progression).

\* This is dependent on what type of game will be made(Will be changed later).

4\. **How-to Guide**

\* I’ll update this section later

5\. **Workshop**

* Lucas or/and me to prepare a workshop on Unity basics relevant to RTS development.

**Potential Final Sprint VR/AR Development**

1\. **Game Concept and Design**

Create a simple game where you can interact with objects(e.g. Pickup blocks, roll a ball, etc.

\*Just an example we can also do something else.

2\. **Programs**

* Unity
* Recommend Visual studio 2022

\*VR Headset needed for development

Visual studio 2022 installer has an option to install the needed packages for unity game development(They might already have that since they have done a game project already)

3\. **Development steps**

Start with the basic VR/AR Template from unity and build up from there

Implement VR/AR specific interactions and mechanics.

4\. **How-To Guide**

\* I’ll update this section later

**General Considerations (All Projects)**

Ensure compatibility with most PCs by optimizing game performance(if possible).

Regularly test and iterate on game mechanics and features(Important).

Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.
